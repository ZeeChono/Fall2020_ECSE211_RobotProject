## Structure
The first level directory contains four folders: **Main Documents, Management, Presentation Material, ProjectController, Supporting Documents, and Final Report**  
The lines following are going to explain the structures of these four main folders.

### Main Documents:
Under this directory, there are **Capabilities Documents, Constraints Documents, Requirements Documents, System Documents**. Each folder contains relative documents with various versions. The naming convention of the documents are `X.AB`, where `X` stands for which week was that document be revised and `AB` stands for how many times that document is modified during that week.
